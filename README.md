# About
The source code for Will Fight for Food: Super Actual Sellout: Game Of The Hour, a RPG / Beat 'em up hybrid by Pyrodactyl Games. 
It's the second game built using my own homebrew engine named CRAB (which stands for Conversation Roleplaying Allpurpose Brawler).

I hope this helps someone out there learning to make games, or someone interested in learning how Unrest works.

# How to Compile
After cloning the repository, you will need to set a valid Boost source and lib directories in Visual Studio settings. 
For more information on how to set up Boost, visit https://www.boost.org/

# Running the Game

After successfully compiling and building the executable, you will need the game's assets. 
If you have a copy of the game, navigate to the install directory and:
1. Copy the "res" folder to the binary location
2. Copy the various DLL files to the binary location

If you're having any issues with getting the code up and running, or just want to chat about the game, feel free to contact me!
